## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)
